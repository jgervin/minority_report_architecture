# MRAS / AdFace — Session Log

Append-only engineering journal across the MRAS multi-repo system
(`minority_report_architecture`, `mras-vision`, `mras-composer`, `mras-display`, `mras-ops`).
Purpose: survive reboots, `/clear`, and context summarization so any future session, skill,
or agent can recover what was done, what was learned, and how to run the system.

## Protocol (read this first, every session)

1. **At session start:** read this file top-to-bottom plus `TODOS.md` and `adface_architecture.md`.
2. **At session end (or before a likely reboot / `/clear`):** prepend a new dated entry under
   "Session Entries" using the template below. Newest first.
3. **Keep it durable, not chatty.** Record: what changed (with repo + commit SHA), what was
   *learned* (non-obvious facts, gotchas), and any new run/operational steps. Skip blow-by-blow.
4. **Cross-repo commits** live in their own repos — always cite `repo@sha`. Working-tree-only
   changes (not yet committed) must be flagged as such.
5. This is the source of truth for "how do I run it" — keep the Operational Reference current.

### Entry template
```
## YYYY-MM-DD — <short title>
**Changes:** repo@sha — one line each.
**Learnings:** non-obvious facts / gotchas discovered.
**State:** what's working / verified, what's pending.
```

## Operational Reference (keep current)

**Topology (IMPORTANT — differs from the original plan doc):**
- `mras-vision` runs **natively on macOS**, NOT in Docker — macOS cannot pass the webcam into a
  container. The compose service has `profiles: ["docker-vision"]` so it is **excluded** from
  default `docker compose up`. Start it with `mras-ops/run-vision-native.sh` (bootstraps an
  arm64 venv at `mras-vision/.venv`, CAM_INDEX=0 = built-in webcam).
- Default `docker compose up` (run from `mras-ops/`) brings up: postgres, qdrant, mras-composer,
  mras-ops-api, mras-ops-frontend.
- **Camera permission:** native vision must be launched from the user's own terminal so macOS can
  prompt for camera access. A background/agent launch gets `not authorized to capture video` and
  the camera task fails (app still serves `/enroll` and `/health` — camera is a background task).

**Ports:** vision 8001, composer 8002, ops-api 8080, ops-frontend 3000, postgres 5432, qdrant 6333.

**TTS:** ElevenLabs primary → **Google Gemini** fallback (MisoOne was replaced). Keys in `mras-ops/.env`.

**Recognition:** confidence threshold 0.68. Below threshold → `is_new_visitor=true` → standard ad
(no name). Enrolled identities seed Qdrant collection `mras_embeddings` (512-dim Cosine).

**Gotchas:**
- The `mras-ops-frontend` container **bakes its source at build time** (no volume mount). After
  editing `frontend/src/*`, redeploy with `docker compose up -d --build mras-ops-frontend`.
- **curl/wget are blocked** by the context-mode guard for HTTP fetches. Use Python `httpx`
  (e.g. `mras-vision/.venv/bin/python`) for enroll/trigger calls.
- Vision tests run via `mras-vision/.venv/bin/python -m pytest` (host pyenv 3.11 lacks deps).
- `mras-kiosk` is a superseded scaffold — the live kiosk is `mras-display`.
- One-command startup: `mras-ops/start-mras.sh` (starts Docker, the compose stack, then native vision).

**Enroll a face (vision must be running):**
```python
# mras-vision/.venv/bin/python
import httpx
csv = b"name,photo\nAlice,alice.jpg\n"
with open("alice.jpg","rb") as f:
    httpx.post("http://localhost:8001/enroll",
        files={"csv_file":("e.csv",csv,"text/csv"),
               "photos":("alice.jpg",f.read(),"image/jpeg")}, timeout=60)
```

## Session Entries (newest first)

## 2026-06-07 — Post-OS-upgrade recovery: fix tests, run-through, enroll, feed columns
**Changes:**
- `mras-vision@31ad695` — TODO-6: fixed Qdrant test mocks. `test_resolver` mocked `qdrant.search`
  but the resolver calls `query_points`, so hits never reached the code: happy-path/cooldown tests
  silently failed and the qdrant-down test passed via an accidental `TypeError` instead of a real
  exception. Fixed mocks to drive `query_points`; added `test_qdrant_down_logs_unavailable_event`.
  Also fixed a `test_reconciler` `_row(embedding=None)` sentinel collision (default replaced the
  explicit None, so "skip row without embedding" could never be exercised). 14/14 vision tests pass.
- `mras-ops@f6c7d13` — added a **date** column to the activity feed (events span multiple days; a
  time-only column made cross-day ordering look scrambled).
- `mras-ops@3a21c47` — added a **confidence** column (green score = matched face, gray `(new)` =
  new-visitor fallback) so recognition vs standard-ad fallback is visible live.
- `mras-vision@9f47af4` — log the **real top similarity score even below threshold**. Previously
  confidence was only recorded on a match, so near-misses logged a misleading `0.00`; now the feed
  shows e.g. `0.61 (new)`, making intermittent recognition and threshold tuning visible. Match
  gating (`is_new_visitor`/`person_uuid` at 0.68) unchanged. (Restart native vision to pick it up.)
- `mras-display` — restored `package.json` (it had been deleted from the working tree though
  committed in `8846164`); ran `npm install` (node_modules was absent). Working-tree restore, no
  new commit. This is why `npm run electron:dev` was erroring with "Missing script".
- `minority_report_architecture/TODOS.md` — marked TODO-6 DONE (working-tree change).
- Enrolled **Jason** (UUID `f487f5b0-ba92-42a8-81f3-1a7a64cb9941`) from
  `mras-vision/spikes/face_recognition/photos/jason_1.jpg`. Qdrant now has 3 points
  (John Anderton, E2EPerson, Jason).
- Added `mras-ops/start-mras.sh` — one-command launcher (starts Docker → compose stack →
  health-waits → native vision in foreground). And this `docs/SESSION_LOG.md` + a journaling
  directive in the root `CLAUDE.md` (Section 5).
- `CLAUDE.md` **Section 6 — Development Workflow**: mandatory branch/worktree isolation, TDD
  red→green→refactor, code review between tasks, clean branch finish (Superpowers skills), GitHub
  push + PR-per-task-batch + remaining-plan-items-as-issues, and a Definition of Done requiring a
  test to fail-then-pass and the branch to be review-ready.
**Learnings:** see Operational Reference above — all of it was (re)confirmed this session. Key new
ones: frontend image bakes source (rebuild on edit); curl blocked → use httpx; camera needs a
real terminal for the macOS permission prompt; vision was found squatting on 8001 inside Docker
(can't see the camera) — must run native.
**State:** Phase 0 verified green end-to-end this session — all `/health` 200; E2E personalized
assembly ~3.3s; recognition path live once native vision is started from a real terminal.
**All 5 repos committed + pushed to `origin/main`; working trees clean.** Also finalized previously
uncommitted Phase 0 work: `mras-ops` (compose qdrant v1.12.6 + docker-vision profile,
run-vision-native.sh, demo mp4 assets, E2E face fixture, CLAUDE.md), `mras-composer` (overlay_text
on assembler + DejaVu font, CLAUDE.md), `mras-display` (.gitignore, lockfile, package.json).
**Test debt:** `mras-composer` `assemble(overlay_text=…)` was committed to main without a test
(user-approved) — first new branch should add the failing-then-passing test per CLAUDE.md §6.
Remaining feature work is Phase 1 deferred (TODO-1..TODO-5).
